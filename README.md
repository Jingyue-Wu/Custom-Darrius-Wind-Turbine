# Custom-Darrius-Wind-Turbine
**Winning design of the ENGINEER 1P13 Renewable Technology Challenge.**

A unique vertical axis wind turbine based on the Darrius Model which has the ability to intake wind from all directions and maximizes efficiency in wind farms. 
* -Design minimizes materials, making it much more cost effective and versatile compared to traditional turbines.
* -Autodesk Inventor was used to design and optimize the model using deflection simulations.
